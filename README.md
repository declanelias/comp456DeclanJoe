# comp456DeclanJoe

Our project, with contributors Joe Margolis and Declan Elias, explores if it is possible to be profitable betting on sports using the concepts of Positive Expected Value Betting and Closing Line value. To find Positive Expected Value Bets, we analyze the performance of different sportsbooks and attempt to create our own model for win probability based on the odds set by the sportsbooks. 

## Expected Value Analysis

### Data Dependencies

All data used can be found in [expected_value/betting_data](https://github.com/declanelias/comp456DeclanJoe/tree/main/expected_value/betting_data). This file contains both the raw data and the clean data. Instructions on how the raw data was collected and cleaned is contained in [expected value final writeup](https://github.com/declanelias/comp456DeclanJoe/blob/main/expected_value/final_work_ev.Rmd).
